An online app that would facilitate the farmer-to-farmer sharing of equipment to reduce costs for individual farming operations by facilitating the pooling of resources.

  organizations: ["CEDO"]
  description: "CEDO has recently published [Burlington's Climate Action Plan](http://www.burlingtonvt.gov/Sustainability/What-is-a-Climate-Action-Plan), in which it sets out goals for the City and its residents to reduce their negative impact on climate. In 2010, the average commute distance was 13 miles one way, with 75% of City employees driving alone to work. The City would like to encourage workers to use alternative methods of commuting to work, thus reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions. Currently, CEDO does track employee commute data by way of a survey. The format, however, generally has a low response rate and is only implemented every two years. CEDO would like to track the employee commute more accurately and regularly, including the time to travel and mode split."

- title: RentRocket
  organizations: ["CEDO"]
  description: "RentRocket is an online rental housing database that crowdsources utility cost and other environmental factors about rental properties. By making this information readily available, the project team hopes that renters can find cost effective and efficient places to live when they are searching for an apartment. In turn, the team hopes this encourages landlords to consider the value of environmental investments and gives them a way to share their environmental achievements. The project is a partnership among 10 cities across the country, and is being funded through the Innovation Fund of the Urban Sustainability Network and the Global Philanthropy Partnership. RentRocket is an open source project built with Django and Python, and is hosted on Google's App Engine. The [source code](https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/green-rental) is available on Github. Contributors are welcome, and the setting up of a Vagrant development environment for the project would be a worthwhile contribution."

  description: "In an emergency, the most effective response is to engage the resources and skills of the entire community—including those of the municipality as well as those of its residents. Relevant resources in an emergency would include tangible items like chainsaws and boats, and would also include skills and knowledge, such as where people are located who know CPR or who are surgeons. The emergency planning capacities of municipalities could implement more effective plans if they have an inventory of these resources and a means of engaging those resources in the event of an emergency. A website or app could manage this data, inviting residents to voluntarily register their resources."

  organizations: ["CEDO"]
  description: "There are many processes within the City that include a public comment component. While this part of the process is often a requirement, it is also helpful to the City in that it provides direct input from the community about their priorities. A public announcement along with the publication of project plans typically leads a public comment process. An app or other tool could be implemented that helps promote and facilitate this feedback process with the community. Critical to this would be considering how the community will engage with this process, from reviewing the plans to providing their comments."

SquaredAway Chicago provides access to resources, knowledge about rights and the ability to document and share issues between tenants and landlords in real time, leading to faster issue resolution, increased accountability and fewer misunderstandings. There is an interest in creating a SquaredAway Vermont version of this service. There are two goals for SquaredAway. First, add features to the SquaredAway web app such as the ability to login via Facebook or Google, translation integration, text messaging capability, or even building a native iOS or Android App. Second, start the process of developing a Vermont version of the app which would include mapping out the project, deciding what features to transfer, crafting new Vermont specific language, and mapping out potential partners."
