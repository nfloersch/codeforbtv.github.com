                <h1>Civic Cloud</h1>
                <p class="lead">The Civic Cloud will provide tools for <strong>innovative community organizers, non-profits and civic hackers</strong> in Burlington, Vermont. The Civic Cloud will build on Burlington’s fiber-optic gigabit network which provides Internet speeds of over 100 times the average national broadband speed.</p>
                <p>The Civic Cloud will be available for the community to use as a <strong>platform for public, non-commercial Internet applications and digital creative works</strong>. Several applications will be deployed during an initial prototyping phase of the Civic Cloud. <strong>High-definition live streaming</strong> will be provided for community media outlets to webcast live public meetings and cultural events. WordPress <strong>websites will be hosted for several Vermont non-profits</strong> including rescue squads, food shelves, job banks and historical societies. A collection of volunteer-developed applications and a state-of-the-art website deployed to the Civic Cloud will help Big Heavy World <strong>preserve and promote Vermont-made music</strong>. Lakecraft, an <strong>educational, multi-user game</strong> aimed at youth and adults that gamifies the Lake Champlain Basin, will also be one of the first applications to run on the Civic Cloud.</p>
                 <blockquote>
                    <p>"We are so pleased to be working with our partners to pioneer the next generation of public, educational and government access. The Civic Cloud combines the best of our community media operations, Burlington Telecom's publicly owned gigabit network, and innovative ideas into a new public resource that will soon become a local treasure and national model."</p>
