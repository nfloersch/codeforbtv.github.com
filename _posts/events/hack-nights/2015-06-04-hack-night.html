    <h2>L3D Cube Assembly Party</h2>
    <p>At the upcoming <a href="/events/2015/06/national-day-of-civic-hacking/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>, participants will be creating prototypes for the large <strong>3D matrix of 52,000 individually-programmable LEDs</strong> on the glass front of the ECHO Lake Aquarium and Science Center building. One of the prototyping tools that will be available are about a dozen <a href="http://lookingglassfactory.com/">L3D Cubes</a>; however, we need to assemble them first. Come by and help put one together!</p>
    <h2>Collaborate on Community and Civic Projects</h2>
