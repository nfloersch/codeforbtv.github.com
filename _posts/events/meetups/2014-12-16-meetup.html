    <h1>Help Big Heavy World Build a Vermont Band Guide</h1>
    <p>Help Big Heavy World represent Vermont's bands and musicians in a new Vermont band guide at <a href="http://www.bigheavyworld.com/">bigheavyworld.com</a>. The volunteer crew has been gathering contact info for musicians across Vermont. Volunteers will build a directory that shares Vermont's amazing music scene with the world.</p>
    <p>Big Heavy World seeks to engage young Vermont volunteers in the creation of live and recorded music, and to become the official Vermont Music Office. Big Heavy World believes that live and recorded original music by Vermonters contributes to the social and economic wellbeing of Vermont, and provides a platform of shared values and experiences that are the foundations of community. Big Heavy World was founded to preserve and promote the music of Vermont; to create economic opportunity for Vermontâ€™s musicians and businesses relating to live and recorded music; to bring Vermont musicians together as a self-empowered community and represent this cultural treasure to ever wider audiences; and to accomplish these goals while engaging and inspiring young Vermont volunteers.</p>
