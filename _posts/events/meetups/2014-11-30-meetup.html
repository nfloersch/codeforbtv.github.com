    <p><strong>PHP and WordPress programmers:</strong> Help Big Heavy World represent Vermont's bands and musicians in a new Vermont band guide at <a href="http://bigheavyworld.com/">bigheavyworld.com</a>! The site is powered by WordPress and the volunteer crew has been gathering contact info for musicians across Vermont. Volunteers will build a directory that shares Vermont's amazing music scene with the world, and connect it to the New England-wide <a href="http://CreativeGround.org/">CreativeGround.org</a> directory so Vermont can shine.</p>
