    <h1>Visualize Environmental Data with Code for BTV and ECHO Lake Aquarium and Science Center</h1>
    <p class="lead">Interested in seeing your environmental data visualization in lights on the front of ECHO Lake Aquarium and Science Center? Thanks to a grant from Google, ECHO will soon be installing a large <strong>3D matrix of 52,000 individually-programmable LEDs</strong> on the glass front of their building. This display will be used to translate environmental data and engage the public in lake stewardship. ECHO needs the help of <strong>artists, programmers, data scientists, designers and others</strong> to create compelling, engaging and interesting visualization prototypes!</p>
